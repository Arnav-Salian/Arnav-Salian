# Arnav Salian [Undergraduate / Web Developer]

Hi! I'm a second-year BSc Computer Science student at the University of Leicester and a Junior Web Developer, continuing to learn and develop my programming skills.

Check out my website [**arnav27.com**](https://arnav27.com/) to see some of my work!

## Web Development Skills

**HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, MySQL, MongoDB, Firebase, Git & GitHub, Vercel, Netlify, WordPress, cPanel, Elementor**

## In Progress

Currently, I'm focusing on learning the following technologies:

**Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript, Next.js, Linux, Docker, Amazon Web Services (AWS)**

I have a solid foundation in programming, algorithms, and software development. My first year introduced me to **Python, JavaScript, and Java**, which sharpened my problem-solving abilities and allowed me to write efficient, structured code.

I'm focusing on full-stack development, working with **React.js** on the front end, and **Node.js and Express.js** on the back end. I use databases like **MongoDB** and **MySQL** to build dynamic, data-driven applications. Additionally, I'm expanding my knowledge of cloud infrastructure through **AWS**.

This ongoing learning journey fuels my passion for creating seamless, responsive websites that deliver great user experiences. Check out my portfolio to explore my latest projects. If youâ€™re interested in collaborating or have any questions, feel free to connect!
